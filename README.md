Welcome to the `eda-steam` repository! This is our final project for the Data Visualization and Storytelling class, where we were tasked with performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to answer key business questions using a dataset of our choice.

## Overview

In this project, we dive into the world of Steam Games to gain insights and tell compelling stories through data analysis. We explore various aspects of the dataset, including game popularity, user reviews, pricing, and more, in order to answer important business questions and uncover trends within the gaming industry.

## Key Business Questions

Our EDA aims to answer several key questions, such as:

- What games had the highest revenue?
- Which publishers should Steam get game licenses from based on the most popular genres?
- What is the acceptable price per genre for these top consistent publishers?

## Dataset

We used the [Steam Store Games Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikdavis/steam-store-games) available on Kaggle, which provides comprehensive information about thousands of games on the Steam platform. The dataset includes data on game titles, genres, user reviews, pricing, and more, making it an excellent resource for our analysis.

## Getting Started

To explore our EDA on Steam Games:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed.

3. Install the required libraries using pip:

   ```shell
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
